                     <h1>Slimey Comments on a game called rocketleague</h1>
                     <p>Dude, Rocket league is hands down one of the most addictive games i've ever played.
                        Soccer but with rocket-boosted cars? thats insane(in a good way ofc). the gameplay
                        is so smooth once you start pulling off aerial shots, saves and last- second goals, you
                        will be hooked. I would love to praise the devs for their devotion by dropping fresh content
                        and new modes to spice up the game . So i highly recommend new players to hop on the game.
                     </p>

                    <h1>Rwarr Comments on a game called Call Of Duty: Warzone</h1>
                    <p>Warzone is hands-down one of the most intense and addictive battle royal games i've ever played. 
                        The fast paced action, realistic gunplay and constant updates keep me coming back for more. Whether am dropping
                        in Verdansk with my squad or going solo on resurgance, every match feels fresh and adrenaline-packed.

                    <p>Fortnight is pure, chaotic fun! The building mechanics make every battle unique and the constent new seasons, skins
                        and crossover events. A great game for all age goups, including 12 year olds can jam the game with his friends and 
                        family, so that makes fortnight one of the most entertaining games out there, its more than just a shooter but a evolving 
                        playground.

                    <h1>DeeZ NutZ posts a comment on a game called Minecraft</h1>
                    <p>It's more than a silly little block game.
                      I've been playing Minecraft since July 2010, so I've seen most major updates for game. The game offers "Infinite wonders
                       and endless possibilities" Minecraft isn't actually infinite or endless, but it might as well be due to the large amount of things
                        you can do with the game. My favorite parts of the game are survival and hardcore singleplayer, and survival multiplayer. Minecraft may 
                        seem simple at first, but there are a lot of mechanics under the hood and there are ways to manipulate the game in unintended ways. Multiplayer 
                        is another big part of Minecraft, where I play on my private servers with friends and family. There are a lot Multiplayer servers, although most are private. 
                        My favorite is my private server and 2b2t, the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft is another experience altogether. In summary, Minecraft is a game that is definitely worth a try, and is more than a simple little block game.

                    <h1>DeeZ NutZ posts a comment on a game called deadbydaylight</h1>
                    <p>Dead by daylight is a mixed bag of a game. On one hand it's got a fantastic game loop and great sound and character design. On the other hand,
                         the core content gets buried under massive grinding and pay to play barriers, toxic mechanics, and bad matchmaking.
                     First thing bad to mention is the nonfunctioning matchmaking. When I had first bought and played the game within my first few games I was already 
                     getting matched up against players at top rank. It made it almost impossible to learn and very miserable to play. Now being somewhere middle in the ranks 
                     (rank 9) I get matched up with bottom tier players and top tier. Almost never with people around my rank. So much about this game would be forgivable if it was fun 
                     but matchmaking that does not work at all ensures it's not. There is not causal mode only ranked.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Tomatro posts a comment on a game called apex-legends</h1>
                    <p>So, after about 25 hours in this game I could tell you something.
                     First of all, game is easy to learn but hard to master, you should learn about movement, mechanics of legends(characters) and their skills. Also, you should master at least main weapons that people mostly use in this game.
                    Good thing that this game doesn't have any toxic players, I've never met someone who said something bad to me. Also, players can tell you about how to do something if you're new player.
                    Comparing to Warzone right now I like this game better, because I've also never experienced any bugs or cheaters. I really like it because I can just chill and play.
                     Perfomance & graphics are pretty good, even some Potato PC can run this game, but mid-range PC I guess will be better. I running game all low, to have good vision and also have more then 144+ fps, but it's still look pretty and my computer fell himself very chill and good.
